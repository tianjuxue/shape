# Mapped shape optimization method for rational design of cellular mechanical metamaterials under large deformation

This repository contains an implementation of our paper on _International Journal of Numerical Methods in Engineering_: "[Mapped shape optimization method for rational design of cellular mechanical metamaterials under large deformation](https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.6941)". We proposed an adjoint-based method for shape optimization of cellular mechanical metamaterials. We discussed three numerical examples in the paper.

Besides what's already in the paper, we also show an educational example of solving the classic compliance minimization problem by running

```bash
python -m src.compliance
```
and the result is as follows:

Here is the objective value versus optimization steps:
